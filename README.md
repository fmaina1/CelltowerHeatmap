# Celltowers Heatmap Project

Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where we create a heatmap of cell towers. We utilize Python's pandas library for data handling and folium library for heatmap visualization.

Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need Python 3 and these Python libraries installed:

pandas
folium
You can install these packages with pip:

shell
Copy code
pip install pandas folium
Project Structure

Celltowers_Heatmap.ipynb : This is the main notebook where all the magic happens. It reads cell tower data, processes it, and generates a beautiful heatmap.
Celltowers - 639.csv : This is the input data file containing information about cell towers.
Usage

To run the notebook, you need to:

Clone this repository
Open Celltowers_Heatmap.ipynb in Jupyter notebook
Update the file_path variable in the second cell with the path of Celltowers - 639.csv
Run the cells in order to see the generated heatmap
